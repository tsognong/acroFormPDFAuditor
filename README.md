## 📖 Usage

1. **[Download the executable file for your operating system here](https://github.com/tsognong/acroFormPDFAuditor/releases/tag/AcroFormPDFAuditor-v1.0.0).**
2. **Choose an installation folder**, then unzip the package.
3. In the directory where the executable is placed, **create one folder**:
   - `Files` → to store your AcroForm PDFs.  
     *(You can organize your PDFs in any folder hierarchy inside this folder, but the root should be within `Files`.)*
4. **Run the application**:
   - On **Windows**, simply double-click the executable.
   - On **Linux**, run:
     ```bash
     ./AcroFormAuditor-v1.0-linux-amd64
     ```
5. Once started, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8081.

6. Use the app’s UI to create and manage validation templates — these are stored internally in a "Templates" folder within your installation directory. No manual template file management is required.
7. That’s it — you’re ready to inspect, validate, and manage your AcroForm PDFs!
